# Airbnb Clone (Under Development)

This project is an **Airbnb clone** built using **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS** templates. The goal is to replicate some of the core functionalities of Airbnb, such as managing property listings, viewing details, and performing basic CRUD operations.

## Features (In Progress)

- **View all listings**: Displays a list of all property listings (basic functionality completed).
- **Create new listings**: Users can add new listings with details like title, description, price, location, and country (still under development).
- **Edit listings**: Users can update existing listings (in progress).
- **Delete listings**: Remove listings from the system (in progress).
- **Detailed view of listings**: Each listing can be viewed in more detail (functionality partially implemented).

## Tech Stack

- **Express**: Web framework for building the server.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store listings data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM to interact with MongoDB.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering HTML pages.
- **Method-Override**: To handle PUT and DELETE requests in forms.
- **ejs-mate**: A simplified version of EJS with extra features like layout support.
